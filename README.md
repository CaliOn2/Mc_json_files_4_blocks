This is a small Python script(located in ressources) built to allow for the creation of json files for minecraft blocks.

To use just copy to to minecraft resources folder and add the generic name files to the other folders.

This exists because Datagen acts up sometimes and causes issues + sorts things alphabetically instead of logically.
